- [ ] Researcher Planned Functionality:
  - [ ] Retrieve information about all his/her past and current trials
  - [ ] Create or close description of clinical trial, target enrollment of patients and doctor
  - [ ] View the list of patients or individual patient info based on id in one of his/her trial
  - [ ] Search for a potential patient who has a particular disease (need consent from patient)
  - [ ] Set up a watch list that gets updated from patients interested in trials and receive notifications when patients with specific disease/conditions become available 
  - [ ] Communicate with other researchers in a discussion board
  - [ ] Search for existing patients who are already participating in a doctors trial
  - [ ] Edit patient profile, add or remove patient in a trial
  - [ ] Edit allogeneic or autologous donor profile, add or remove donor from a trial
  - [ ] Register with the site, on the backend, make sure password is encrypted/hashed in DB table, login, create a researcher account by name and organization 

- [ ] Patient Planned Functionality:
  - [ ] Set up a watch list and receive notifications when new trials/grants are available.
  - [ ] Retrieve information on all past and current trials related to the one theyâ€™ll participate in
  - [ ] View the list of researchers or individual researcher info by id for their trial
  - [ ] Register on the site, on the backend, make sure password is encrypted/hashed in DB table, login, view their own profile
